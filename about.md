<p>Hi! I'm a first year grad student at NYU's Courant Institute. I love building products that leverage Machine Learning to solve problems. My latest obsession is over Music Information Retrieval and am building tools to improve music recommendation. I also occasionally scribble some scripts on Vision. I mostly code in C++ and love Python. Also,  am really curious about Scala and OCaml functional languages.</p>

BTW, this site loads real [fast](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=ykumards.com&tab=mobile).
