- I live in New York City. Am terrified of the possibility of falling asleep on a subway.
- I enjoy working with learning algorithms, all the while controlling my paranoia that computers would get smarter than me someday. 
- Lately, I've been obsessed with the elegance of Functional Programming. 
- I spend my evenings running along Hudson dreaming of owning a pretty white yacht someday. 
- I also read books of all kind, I write reviews occasionally for the ones I really love.

Also feel free to look around. I write about everything under the sun and occasionally write technical stuff (they're the highlighted posts). BTW, did you notice? This site loads real [fast](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=ykumards.com&tab=mobile).
