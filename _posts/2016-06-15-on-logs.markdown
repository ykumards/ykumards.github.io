I usually keep a log of interesting things I come across for future reference (stashed in Evernote or Pocket), but there was no consistency in this. More often than now, I simply forget to maintain this log. I think it will be useful to write a weekly post for collecting such info. This will keep the motivation going and engage in a variety of inteesting stuff. Also, this would enable me to write something down everyweek, as blog posts usually take much longer to conceive and write.

So I'll just tag these posts as 'logs' and they can be searched [here](http://ykumards.com/tags/#logs).
