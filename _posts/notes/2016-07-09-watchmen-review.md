My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1653927115">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
<strong>Who watches the watchmen?</strong><br>My first book from the graphic novel genre, and I seemed to have picked up the best. The artwork captivates you from page 1; perfectly portrays the grim darkness of the cold-war era New York city, dingy, drab, filled with an aura of cynicism and the palpable tension from an impending nuclear holocaust. Moore's characterization of these heroes is intricate, it breaks away from the run-of-the-mill superhero BS of noble ideologies and unicorn sentiments. Here, it's realistic... grisly -- <em>"Existence is random. Has no pattern save what we imagine after staring at it for too long. No meaning save what we choose to impose. This rudderless world is not shaped by vague metaphysical forces"</em>. <br>This novel is only a stone's throw away from being a pure work of psychological realism. Shows why a story about a bunch of superheros needn't always suck (ahem, Marvel!).
