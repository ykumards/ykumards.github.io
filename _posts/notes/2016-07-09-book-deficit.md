I do this ceremoniously every New Year's day, I open [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/) and sign-up for that year's [reading challenge](https://www.goodreads.com/challenges/3890-2016-reading-challenge). And if you look at my past record, it's not been that [good](). I start off with a simple idea that I could finish a book a week, which is not that daunting a task when you consider my reading speed :grinning: but I tend to lose track of this. 

This year for example, I am behind by [19](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/3853094) books as of now and to complete my goal of 50 books by the end of this year, I have 44 to go in around 6 months! Let me get my excuses out of the way quickly now, this year was busy with all the programming interviews and complex courses (Operating Systems, for example), also I've been working on other side projects all along. But that's no excuse, obviously. 

Let's go ahead and do the math. I have just over 175 days left to complete 44 books, thats an average of 4 days per book. Not difficult till you consider my programming projects that are currently underway (more on them soon :wink:). However, I think I can squeeze in 2 hours a day for reading books and with that the time I get to finish a book is about 8 hours. That's not difficult if I pick moderate sized books (Infinite Jest has to wait). 

I have here a list of books I've compiled for this year's reading list:

 1. On Writing :heavy_check_mark:
