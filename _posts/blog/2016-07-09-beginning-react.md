React JS took the front-end dev world by storm as soon as [Facebook](https://facebook.github.io/react/) launched it about 3 years ago. Since then it has grown to become more efficient and powerful. There is a whole ecosystem of React based tools (Redux, React Native, etc...) that it got a bit daunting to get started on it.

I'm new to JS web frameworks. I started with Java and then later relied on the simplicity of Python-based frameworks (Flask, you beauty) to get the job done. JS was mostly used for tweaking the responsiveness of the front-end, nothing fancy. Yup, this makes me a dinosaur in today's world of web development. After some initial skepticism, I understood why the world needs good JS frameworks. Anyway, that was the idea behind getting started with React, because I hear it's the best.

Everyone gets started by building this comment box with the [official react tutorial](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html). But after this, things get a bit tricky. I couldn't really find any resource that would explain the whole React ecosystem well. I'll try to organise some of what I could understand in the following few posts. Mostly, the material comes from the [Tyler Mcginnis'](https://twitter.com/tylermcginnis33) [course](http://courses.reactjsprogram.com/courses/reactjsfundamentals). Do take a look at it if you get a chance, it's free!
