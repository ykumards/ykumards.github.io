I came across this post from [John Resig](http://ejohn.org/blog/write-code-every-day/) a while back and have been meaning to do this ever since. I have realized that consistency in programming is probably the most important ingredient for improving one's programming skills. Anyway, I usually get excited about something new, like a programming language or a framework and after playing around with it for a while and then lose touch. It would be better for me if I could organize some of this work.

I already have a few repos on github, and their commit chart should keep me motivated. To obligate myself further, I'll also write a short note or an elaborate blog post about my work **everyday**. Of course modifying docs or HTML pages doesn't count as a commit.

#### Topics to consider

- Clojure & Scala
- Spotify API
- React JS and Native
- Collaborate on open source projects ([Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) has my attention)
- Post SICP solved exercise code and notes (I hope to cover a lot of ground this summer)
