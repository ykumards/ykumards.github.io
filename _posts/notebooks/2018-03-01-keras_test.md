## Preliminaries


```python
# Load libraries
import numpy as np
from keras.datasets import imdb
from keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer
from keras import models
from keras import layers

# Set random seed
np.random.seed(0)
```

    Using TensorFlow backend.


## Load IMDB Movie Review Data


```python
# Set the number of features we want
number_of_features = 1000

# Load data and target vector from movie review data
(train_data, train_target), (test_data, test_target) = imdb.load_data(num_words=number_of_features)

# Convert movie review data to a one-hot encoded feature matrix
tokenizer = Tokenizer(num_words=number_of_features)
train_features = tokenizer.sequences_to_matrix(train_data, mode='binary')
test_features = tokenizer.sequences_to_matrix(test_data, mode='binary')
```

## Construct Neural Network Architecture With Dropout Layer

In Keras, we can implement dropout by added `Dropout` layers into our network architecture. Each `Dropout` layer will drop a user-defined hyperparameter of units in the previous layer every batch. Remember in Keras the input layer is assumed to be the first layer and not added using the `add`. Therefore, if we want to add dropout to the input layer, the layer we add in our is a dropout layer. This layer contains both the proportion of the input layer's units to drop `0.2` and `input_shape` defining the shape of the observation data. Next, after we add a dropout layer with `0.5` after each of the hidden layers.


```python
# Start neural network
network = models.Sequential()

# Add a dropout layer for input layer
network.add(layers.Dropout(0.2, input_shape=(number_of_features,)))

# Add fully connected layer with a ReLU activation function
network.add(layers.Dense(units=16, activation='relu'))

# Add a dropout layer for previous hidden layer
network.add(layers.Dropout(0.5))

# Add fully connected layer with a ReLU activation function
network.add(layers.Dense(units=16, activation='relu'))

# Add a dropout layer for previous hidden layer
network.add(layers.Dropout(0.5))

# Add fully connected layer with a sigmoid activation function
network.add(layers.Dense(units=1, activation='sigmoid'))
```

## Compile Neural Network


```python
# Compile neural network
network.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', # Cross-entropy
                optimizer='rmsprop', # Root Mean Square Propagation
                metrics=['accuracy']) # Accuracy performance metric
```

## Train Neural Network


```python
# Train neural network
history = network.fit(train_features, # Features
                      train_target, # Target vector
                      epochs=3, # Number of epochs
                      verbose=0, # No output
                      batch_size=100, # Number of observations per batch
                      validation_data=(test_features, test_target)) # Data for evaluation
```
