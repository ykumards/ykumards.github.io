This page is built on Jekyll, a Ruby based static site generator and is based on the theme developed by the awesome designer [Michael Rose](https://mademistakes.com/). 

The site's beautiful icons come from [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) and typography is [Source Sans Pro](https://adobe-fonts.github.io/source-sans-pro/). [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) was used for the design and templating of the pages.

And finally, this site is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
