Since then it has grown to become more efficient and powerful. There is a whole ecosystem of React based tools (Redux, React Native, etc…) that it got a bit daunting to get started on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m new to JS web frameworks. I started with Java and then later relied on the simplicity of Python-based frameworks (Flask, you beauty) to get the job done. JS was mostly used for tweaking the responsiveness of the front-end, nothing fancy. Yup, this makes me a dinosaur in today’s world of web development. After some initial skepticism, I understood why the world needs good JS frameworks. Anyway, that was the idea behind getting started with React, because I hear it’s the best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone gets started by building this comment box with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html&quot;&gt;official react tutorial&lt;/a&gt;. But after this, things get a bit tricky. I couldn’t really find any resource that would explain the whole React ecosystem well. I’ll try to organise some of what I could understand in the following few posts. Mostly, the material comes from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tylermcginnis33&quot;&gt;Tyler Mcginnis’&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://courses.reactjsprogram.com/courses/reactjsfundamentals&quot;&gt;course&lt;/a&gt;.

My rating: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1653927115&quot;&gt;5 of 5 stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Who watches the watchmen?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first book from the graphic novel genre, and I seemed to have picked up the best. The artwork captivates you from page 1; perfectly portrays the grim darkness of the cold-war era New York city, dingy, drab, filled with an aura of cynicism and the palpable tension from an impending nuclear holocaust. Moore’s characterization of these heroes is intricate, it breaks away from the run-of-the-mill superhero BS of noble ideologies and unicorn sentiments. Here, it’s realistic… grisly – &lt;em&gt;“Existence is random. Has no pattern save what we imagine after staring at it for too long. No meaning save what we choose to impose. This rudderless world is not shaped by vague metaphysical forces”&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;This novel is only a stone’s throw away from being a pure work of psychological realism. Shows why a story about a bunch of superheros needn’t always suck (ahem, Marvel!).

I have realized that consistency in programming is probably the most important ingredient for improving one’s programming skills. Anyway, I usually get excited about something new, like a programming language or a framework and after playing around with it for a while and then lose touch. It would be better for me if I could organize some of this work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I already have a few repos on github, and their commit chart should keep me motivated. To obligate myself further, I’ll also write a short note or an elaborate blog post about my work &lt;strong&gt;everyday&lt;/strong&gt;. Of course modifying docs or HTML pages doesn’t count as a commit.&lt;/p&gt;
