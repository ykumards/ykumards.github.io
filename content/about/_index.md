Hi there!

I’m Yogesh Kumar, a CS grad student at NYU’s Courant Institute.

I live in New York City. Am terrified of the possibility of falling asleep on a subway.

I spend most of my time tinkering with Machine Learning algorithms, specially interested in the ones that try to learn someone’s taste in music.

I also code in Functional Languages (Clojure is my latest obsession) and try to chug along [SICP](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html).

I spend my evenings running along the Hudson dreaming of owning a pretty white yatch someday. I also read books of all kind, I write reviews occasionally for the ones I really love.
