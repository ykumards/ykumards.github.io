I noticed this with stand-up comedy when I hear a great joke from, say, Bill Burr or John Mulaney and want to share it with someone. I almost always butcher the delivery and the joke doesn’t seem that funny anymore. I try real hard to mimic the exact delivery of the joke, the pauses, emphasis on the right syllables, everything to the book, but the joke still doesn’t have the same effect. That’s when I give up and just share a YouTube link, then the joke always draws out a laugh from my friend. Practice and experience. I think that’s what I was lacking, and probably also the talent for stand-up.

In many ways, writing is similar. As an aspiring story-teller I often try to observe the technique a writer uses in a book. Some great writers can take an ordinary event and pen it down so well by adding all the glitz and glamour. When you write down all the exact details of the event, you write an encyclopedia, but when you make the reader feel like he is walking in the same city and breathing the same air as the characters, you write a great novel. Practice, experience and talent.

When I finished reading The Things They Carried by Tim O’Brien and looked back at all the quotes I had highlighted through the book, I realized that this book was about storytelling. Sure, this was about the Vietnam War, written by the author who was actually in that war. It was about the emotions that the soldiers felt, how they were just pushed onto the battlefield underprepared and unmotivated. It was about the friends lost during those years and how they coped with the years after war. But underneath all this, it was a confession (as one of the reviewers astutely observed), it was a way for the author to get things off his chest. This book was a collection of anecdotes, like those you’d hear from an old war veteran sitting alone in a subway cart, if you took the time to chat him up. The stories were extraordinary, so extraordinary that even a mediocre writer could have captivated the reader with it. O’Brien never fully focused on the nitty-gritty, because that’s not what matters. These stories had a purpose, not to describe the gore and chaos of the Vietnam War, but to give identity to the soldiers who fought in it. In one chapter, the author described how everyone was indistinguishable from each other when they had mud smeared across their face, I think this book was about washing off that mud.

I’ll leave you with some of these highlights from the book.

> “That’s what stories are for. Stories are for joining the past to the future. Stories are for those late hours in the night when you can’t remember how you got from where you were to where you are. Stories are for eternity, when memory is erased, when there is nothing to remember except the story.”

> “A true war story is never moral. It does not instruct, nor encourage virtue, nor suggest models of proper human behavior, nor restrain men from doing the things men have always done. If a story seems moral, do not believe it. If at the end of a war story you feel uplifted, or if you feel that some small bit of rectitude has been salvaged from the larger waste, then you have been made the victim of a very old and terrible lie.”

> “By telling stories, you objectify your own experience. You separate it from yourself. You pin down certain truths. You make up others.“

> “The thing about a story is that you dream it as you tell it, hoping that others might then dream along with you, and in this way memory and imagination and language combine to make spirits in the head.“
