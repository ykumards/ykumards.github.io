Life is pointless, right? You have a lifelong dream of achieving some goal, then what happens after you achieve it? Boredom. I once went on a jungle safari in Southern India searching for elephants. I had never seen a wild elephant before and spent the whole evening driving around trying to spot one. It was tiring, but the expectation added a bit of fun. Finally, I spotted a tusker going to town on a branch of bamboo. I saw the elephant, the elephant saw me, and then the elephant continued chewing the bamboo branch nonchalantly. It was my first brush with existentialism. What was the point of spending the whole evening trying to spot this bamboo eater? It amounted to nothing and I should have just left him alone. Please don’t go on a safari, imagine someone pointing a camera at you while you devour a T-bone steak. I digress.

I think the sole benefit of having goals is not gained by achieving them, it is gained during the process of achieving the goal. Driving around with the expectation of finding a majestic elephant was enthralling. Having a staring contest with a bored elephant, not so much. So I found this iOS app called Streaks, where you can set up to 12 habits that you want to develop. The app gives me a to-do list for everyday and keeps track of the streak count for each of those tasks. When you’re well into a streak for a certain task, you get this extra motivation to complete it (like how am trying to fill this blog post up with gibberish right now). Cultivating good habits is the stepping stone to achieving any goal, and that my friend, is the secret to happiness.

Now am really out of topics to write about. Maybe tomorrow I’ll write about writer’s block.
