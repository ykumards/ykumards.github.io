So I haven’t been here since November 24 of last year and this is supposed to be a daily blog. I have my excuse ready – I’ve moved to a new country! So on New Year’s day 2019, I hopped on a flight from Bangalore and moved to Helsinki. On hindsight, I could have picked a more favorable month to move. January is really brutal here, there’s snow everywhere and it is really annoying when it gets in your shoes.

I like Finland though. People are nice and polite. Mostly they keep it to themselves and don’t go around throwing fake plesantaries (ahem… SoCal). And there’s an ever-present palpable silence everywhere, which I absolutely love.

But I don’t get to meet the Sun very often. Even on those rare non-overcast days, Sun only shines between 9 in the morning to 4 in the evening. It’s lazier than a DMV employee, right? Also, the temperatures has been consistently subzero ever since I moved here. So there’s not much I can do when I am outside besides walking as quickly as possible to the nearest temperate controlled room.

Good times!
