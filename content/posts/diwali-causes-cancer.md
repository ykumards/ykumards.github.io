I love Diwali as much as the next guy, but I am done with this fireworks BS. I donâ€™t know why sane people still insist on lighting fireworks during Diwali. The toll this has on the environment is obvious. One would expect that during the age of PS4 and fortnite, it would be easier to get kids off of fireworks. As I drove through the city today, I could see the heavy metallic smoke emitted from these fireworks hover over the whole city. I saw poor street dogs running amok everywhere because they were so confused about all this sudden noise. Hope this stops soon.
