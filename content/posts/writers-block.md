Oh my, oh my. How naive was I, to assume that I’d have anything worthwhile to tell you everyday. Nope, I have nothing. Brick friggin’ wall. (Allow me to take the liberty of calling myself a writer) So this is what writer’s block feels like. It’s 10pm everyday by the time I get to sit and write something. I have other chores to complete, don’t I? The 2 hour deadline until midnight to write something interesting drives me crazy. I have so many drafts open with unfinished blogs, I gave up on them because they suck. I can write about the books I read, but I take an average of 3-4 days to complete one. Majority of those books are just meh, and provide nothing useful to write about. Maybe I can write about the news, but why would you come here to read about that?

I never was at a lose for words when I write my journal. But we’re not that close, I can’t tell you personal stuff. Okay, I’ll tell you one personal stuff; I think I’m going bald (although others assure me I’m not), so I spent some time today researching hair transplantation and might have to start saving for it soon. I haven’t the slightest idea why planting hair nodes on a bald head should cost so much. Maybe there’s a monopoly there. Someone should file an anti-trust lawsuit against them. But this is not interesting, right?
