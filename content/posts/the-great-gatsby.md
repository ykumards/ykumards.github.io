Don’t judge me, but I finished reading The Great Gatsby only last week. I know, I know, it’s a classic, but I never cared for stories about rich people and their extravagant parties and their first world problems. This year however, I have been covering a lot of classic novels and decided to give this a try. I was hooked from the very first sentence:

> “In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I’ve been turning over in my mind ever since. ‘Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,’ he told me, ‘just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had.”

Is this book about empathetic rich people? Now that I can withstand. It didn’t take me long to find out that F. Scott Fitzgerald is a magician when it comes to bringing forth some extraordinary metaphors. Fitzgerald is one of those authors whose books you read and wonder “I can never write like that”. Check out this sentence which basically says, “it got dark while she was talking to me”:

>“For a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her glowing face; her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as I listened—then the glow faded, each light deserting her with lingering regret like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk.”

I most certainly can never write like this.

Of course the book is not just about rich people having parties. I see this novel (and found some other reviewers who thought the same) as pointing a giant mirror at the myth of the American Dream – “if you work hard and with honesty, you can buy a car and a TV with HBO and own a 40 year mortgage on a house”, or something like that. Basically, anyone can become rich and move to Beverly Hills if he wants to. It is the opposite of the aristocratic society in countries like Great Britain (or Harry Potter) where a commoner can never be a part of the elite, no matter how rich he is.

Gatsby was born a commoner, but worked hard (and had some favorable luck) to become rich. But no matter how big is mansion and how generous his parties, the other rich people always saw him with suspicion. And unlike the rich people who had “smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together and let other people clean up the mess they had made”, Gatsby had to pay a heavy price for his mistake. So the book points out that the American Dream isn’t really true, the rich and the poor have different rules.

This was definitely one of the best books I’ve read and Fitzgerald has become one of my favorite authors.
