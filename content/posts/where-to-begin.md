I firmly believed that people with uninteresting lives shouldn’t start a daily blog. What’s there to share? This belief kept me clear off having any blogging ambitions. Besides the creative procrastination and occasional bouts of coding, my life is fairly uneventful for 99/100 days (once every 3 months I attempt to run for 3 miles and nearly get a heart attack).

Then I realized that like any person nearing his mid-life crisis danger zone, I need some form of creative outlet. Guitar strings hurt my fingers too much and I couldn’t draw you a discernible pony even if you had an AR-15 to my head, so that left me with writing. I am okay with writing, I can string together a few sentences barely enough to make sense. So here we are…

I’ve read Stephen King’s book ‘On Writing’ on writing. His methodology for creativity is consistency. You write a fixed number of words, everyday, without breaks, and you end up getting better at writing. So I’ve decided to publish something (even if it is only a couple of paragraphs) everyday. I even set up a nice calendar widget to keep track of my writing streaks. Hopefully I’ll have something useful to to write about everyday. Hopefully this exercise will force encourage me to do interesting things in life, like bungee jumping or talking to a homeless person in the subway. Let’s hope so.
