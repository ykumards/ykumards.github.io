People often talk about their fear of speaking to strangers, or even to friends sometimes. How many times have we sat there in the awkward silence for what feels like an eternity, when you run out of any topics to discuss. I have deliberately worked on my conversation skills as an adult and can keep up a fairly interesting conversation with people. People usually open up when you talk about their work or their city (especially New Yorkers) or if you have nothing else, about the weather (especially with Americans). But what is so uncomfortable about the silence?

Silences always end up being awkward, its when the mobile phones pop out, followed by the mindless scrolls through some social media website. My mind usually goes into a panic mode when confronted with prolonged calm, thatâ€™s when a poorly constructed joke or a gossip about an old friend is brought out. Why canâ€™t two people just sit there and not talk and just ruminate their thoughts? It is possible that a conversation with periodic pauses could be profound, something that actually could leave a lasting impression on the other person. President Obamaâ€™s speeches used to have so many pauses, and it made you feel like he is trying to take the effort to say the right things, that he is not just winging it. He made you feel special. Wonâ€™t it be nice to make your interlocutor (okay I admit, I googled that word) feel that way?

Good luck, whoever is going to end up having coffee with me next ðŸ™‚
