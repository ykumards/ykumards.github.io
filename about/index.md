Hi there!

I'm Yogesh Kumar, a second year CS grad student at NYU's Courant Institute. My public key is [A748 3CA9 A786 54E0](https://keybase.io/ykumards).

- I live in New York City. Am terrified of the possibility of falling asleep on a subway.

- I spend most of my time tinkering with Machine Learning algorithms, specially interested in the ones that try to learn someone's taste in music. 

- I also coding in Functional Languages (Clojure is my latest obsession) and try to chug along [SICP](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html).

- I spend my evenings running along the Hudson dreaming of owning a pretty white yatch someday. I also read books of all kind, I write reviews occasionally for the ones I really love.
