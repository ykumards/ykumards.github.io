<p>Hi there!</p>

<p>I’m Yogesh Kumar, a second year CS grad student at NYU’s Courant Institute. My public key is <a href="https://keybase.io/ykumards">A748 3CA9 A786 54E0</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I live in New York City. Am terrified of the possibility of falling asleep on a subway.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I spend most of my time tinkering with Machine Learning algorithms, specially interested in the ones that try to learn someone’s taste in music.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also coding in Functional Languages (Clojure is my latest obsession) and try to chug along <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html">SICP</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I spend my evenings running along the Hudson dreaming of owning a pretty white yatch someday. I also read books of all kind, I write reviews occasionally for the ones I really love.</p>
